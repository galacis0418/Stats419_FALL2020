macro:->Sometimes
when
looking
for
data
that
was
fabricated
or
altered
incorrectly
it
can
be
very
hard
to
find.\newline
So
finding
a
good
method
for
searching
out
the
data
is
probably
the
most
important
part.
In
this
graphic
we
can
easily
see
data
that
is
significanly
off
the
normal
path.
Both
above
and
below
the
median.
This
is
a
great
visual
example
of
failed
Data
Integrity.

I
mainly
used
the

I
created

I
felt
it
was
more

that
I
put
