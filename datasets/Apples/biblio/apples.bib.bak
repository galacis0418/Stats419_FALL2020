@article{Dasgupta:2001,
Abstract = {In experiments from the life sciences, application of logistic regression techniques is common. Often it is imperative to compare the slopes of several of logistic regressions to that of a standard. In this article we define a test statistic based on the difference of minimal sufficient statistics and we present two techniques for dealing with this problem for small samples. In the first approach we use the distribution function of the statistic and propose a pivoted small-sample procedure. In the second approach we use step-down permutation test. We compare these methods with existing asymptotic methods and show that the proposed methods outperform their competitors in terms of both Type 1 error and marginal power. The research is motivated by a problem in plant pathology which we include as our data example. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
