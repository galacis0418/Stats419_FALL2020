## TESTING PROCEDURE
 
This midterm exam (Rnotebook-midterm) is worth 150 points.  For each question, review how much the item is worth in terms of points and plan your time wisely. 

I would deem it "unwise" to spend hours on a question that is only worth 5 points.

### Static/Existing Resources Are Allowed
 
This is an open-book examination.  You can use your course notebooks (digital and old-school).  You can use Internet resources (stackoverflow, Wikipedia, and Youtube).  

### Dynamic/Living Resources Are _ **NOT**_  Allowed

**You cannot use a living resource on the exam.**  That would include a classmate, student, sibling, parent, a tutor, online forums (where you ask the question after the exam period has begun). 

If you have questions that need clarifying, please **email the instructor** and he will try to answer them by email or ZOOM.  He will be checking his email often during the week of the exam, to make himself available to you.

### Levels of Mastery

* Do You **Remember**?
* Do You **Understand**?
* Can You **Apply** what you remember/understand to another similar problem?
* Can You **Analyze** and **Synthesize** Data?
* Can You **Evaluate** your analyses?
* Can You **Create** meaningful visualizations and summaries?  

### Rubric of Mastery 
 
For every 10 points, this is the general breakdown.
 
| Emerging       | Developing     | Mastering    |
| :------------- | :----------:   | -----------: |
| 0-4            |  5-7           | 8 - 10       |

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics.

Confirmatory data analysis (CDA) is the process of applying specific statistical methods to analyze the data.  The goal is also to summarize its main characteristics.  We commonly refer to CDA as "statistical hypothesis testing".  CDA generally makes assumptions about how the data is distributed.  Or wants to apply a specific model to the data.

So the two approaches have the same objective:  summarize the main characteristics of the data.  How they achieve that objective is very different.  

## Introduction 

### John Tukey
John Tukey is the father of "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey>.  My favorite statistics book is his 1977 book (not surprising) entitled "Exploratory Data Analysis."

### Exploratory vs Confirmatory
From Wikipedia (Accessed October 2020):  Tukey "also contributed to statistical practice and articulated the important distinction between exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis, **believing that much statistical methodology placed too great an emphasis on the latter**."

I belong to the "Tukey" camp. I believe too much emphasis is place on "formal statistical methods and tests".  I believe more emphasis should be placed on the underlying nature of the data.  These underlying principles are how the statistical methods developed.  

As a data analyst, I believe that first and foremost, we should let the data speak.  That is why the first half of the semester started in this form.  The second half (confirmatory data analysis) will rely on what is labeled by many as "formal statistical methods".

### Tukey and "Bell Labs"

In 1965, Tukey divided his time between working at Princeton University and working at Bell Labs (a research think tank).  

#### Robust Statistics as Nonparametric

Tukey proposed that five summary data are essential to understanding numerical data:  `min`, `max`, `median` (technically `Q2`), and `Q1` and `Q3` (the quartiles).  In `R`, the function `summary` has only added `mean` to Tukey's proposal from years ago.

#### Box and Whisker Plot 

In 1975, Tukey invented the "box and whisker" plot that identifies the median, inter-quartile range (IQR), and outliers of data.  The visualization displays the data without making any assumptions about its statistical distribution.  The boxplot is a working demonstration of EDA.  **Let the data speak!**

### John Chambers and `S` and `R`
At the same time ast John Tukey, three other men were also working at Bell Labs (John Chambers, Rick Becker, and Allan Wilks) on a statistical programming language `S` that emphasized EDA.  This "statistical computing" language was programming mostly in `Fortran` with some `C` programming.    Chambers published his first "statistical computing" text in 1977, titled "Computational methods for data analysis" <https://archive.org/details/computationalmet0000cham/page/n11/mode/2up>

Between 1988 and 1991, Chambers updated the engine of `S` to make it more robust.  That same engine still powers much of `R` today.  That is, much of the base code of `S` was written by Chambers himself. `R` today still uses much of that `S` codebase under the hood.  

`R` was an open-source offshoot (a "fork") of `S` which occurred in the mid 1990s.  Today, Chambers is still active in the `S`-now`R` community.  My favorite book of his is titled (2008): "Software for data analysis programming with R".  My second-favorite book of his is titled (1998): "Programming with data: a guide to the S language".  In 2016, he authored another book that I still need to read "Extending R."  

Modern `R` is written in `Fortran`, `C`, and `C++`.  

Since its foundation is primarily `C`, we can use standard "make" and "make-install" tools to compile R or its packages from the source code.  That is why we needed `Rtools` on Windows.  The MacOS is now linux based, so no additional tools are required.

## Summary

EDA as exploration is an iterative process.  

### Analogy: learning a foreign language
I like to use the analogy of learning a foreign language using the "immersion" approach. For example, I studied Spanish in high school, learned vocabulary and grammar, and really could not speak the language well.  

I did learn to speak the language well by being dropped into a foreign country for nearly two years.  Some key ingredients to learn a language in an "immersive" environment are listed below:  

- surround yourself with others speaking the language to be learned [e.g., I did not spend a lot of time with other Americans speaking English]. 
- be present when engaged in the language.  Listen intently and try to understand as much as you can, not worrying about what you don't fully understand.  

- reflect after language engagement.  Try to synthesize what "gaps" you have and then develop study habits to fill in those gaps.

- practice what you have learned.

To some degree, my success was likely accelerated because I had precursory training.  Regardless, "immersive" practices benefit learning new languages.

### Proficiency in Data Analytics

[As part of your journey, I have asked you to keep a "paper-and-pencil" notebook to write down words/phrases/ideas.  For example, in this section, there may be words/terms/phrases/ideas you don't fully understand.]

Proficiency requires an iteration of these key features described above.  But first, you have to understand what language you are trying to speak.  Is it `R`?  Is it Statistics?  Mathematics?  What exactly is the language?

In my opinion, the language is the "language of data". 

### The "language of data"

How do you think mathematics developed?  It likely started with simple data, based on real-world experience:  two hands, five fingers on each hand gives me the number ten.  Counting in a base-10 system likely resulted.  An entire domain of mathematics called "number theory" devotes its studies to these integer values.

How do you think statistics developed?  People went out and started measuring things.  One person would literally walk down the street in the late 1800s and ask if he could measure a person's proportions.  Another person would study crop yields at different locations and tried to ascertain if they were different. 

The foundation of mathematics and statistics is data. So I believe, we should let the data speak.

### Let the data speak

So I am definitely an EDA-guy.  Some people are, some people are not.  I personally am a strong believer that we should **let the data speak**, learn how to describe the data without imposing any restrictions on it, and always think about the data first and foremost.  

I also believe that we should use logic, intuition, and insight before we develop any formal "confirmatory" hypothesis testing.  I have intentionally architected this course to emphasis EDA.

### Quality data provenance

I am also very ademant about **data provenance** as I believe the "outputs" of any analysis (whether exploratory or confirmatory) is as only as good as the data quality.  I call this `data intimacy`.  You should care just as much about the process to get quality data as you do to analyze said data.

The term **GIGO** (garbage-in, garbage-out) in my estimation represents what happens when care for quality data is treated lightly.  

### Iterative Exploration
This full EDA approach is a multi-lens approach.  View the data from as many different perspectives as possible before arriving at a conclusion.  Base your conclusion on a synthesis of what you analyzed from those different perspectives.

- We do initial EDA (using mathematical foundations), 
- then we may do confirmatory analyses (traditional statistical methods), and 
- then we synthesize our findings and do a higher-ordered EDA using the original analysis and the confirmatory analysis to make final decisions using sound logic and intuition.
- this process will enlighten our understand and possibly help us formulate new suppositions and think about what additional data would inform the topic.

## (10 points) YOUR "EDA" OPINION 
[
I have expressed my opinion about the study of data and the importance of EDA in that study.  What is your opinion on this topic?

This is worth 10 points, a minimal answer should be at least 3 paragraphs. Agreeing/Disagreeing with my opinion is not how you will be evaluated.  How well you express YOUR opinion is what is important.]

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- EDA vs CDA, I find EDA to not only be just as useful if not more so than CDA, but also the one that is significantly more thought provoking.
CDA is more of the hard math, such as finding the significance, inference, and confidence to test your hypothesis.  But to get the Hypothesis
in the first place is where the real deep thought comes in. 
  For example, take a set of data and start sifting through it looking for patterns a clues, manipulating the data and looking from different 
  viewpoints, doing this you can find something that is changing in the data, and using that changing data you can find something that looks like
  it is causing the change.  This whole process is EDA.  Looking for the issues and potential causes and coming up with a hypothesis on why this is 
  happening.
  CDA is the next logical step after that, using your hypothesis and using the hard math to try to prove it.  While it isn't easy to do this step
  it isn't nearly as thought provoking. so for example, if we take that hypothesis and build a predictive model that compares the data using the 
  hypothesis you made that would be CDA. 
  They are both necessary and useful, but EDA is the one that is the basis of data analytics.  They also are not just back to back, it isn't just
  do EDA and then do CDA, no you need to do EDA and then test with CDA and then go back and reframe your hypothesis with EDA again. This helps create
  the best possible model for the dataset.--

## SIMULATING DATA 

### (10 points) Basic Simulation 

- Pick a `set.seed` choice so the code is replicable.  Verify that every time you run the commands, the data is not changing with the seed "you chose".
- Use the functions `rnorm`, `runif` to simulate data.  
- Simulate `n=9999;` data for each.  
- Call `x.rnorm` the data for the first and `x.runif` the data for the second.  
- Plot a histogram `graphics::hist` and report the summary statistics ``base::summary` of each. 
- Then, plot them using `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);`.  
- Finally, `plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm) );` and compare it to `plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif) );`.  


#### Code of simulation
```{r, chunk-simulating-rnorm-runif, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

set.seed(5)
x.rnorm = rnorm(9999, 0, 1)
x.runif = runif(9999, 0, 1)

hist(x.rnorm, main = "rnorm simulated data to 9999")
hist(x.runif, main = "runif data to  9999")
     
plot(x.rnorm, x.runif)

plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm));

plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif) );

```

#### **Describe `rnorm`, `runif`**

- Describe what each function `rnorm` and `runif` does. How are they similar?  How are they different?  
- What does the `sample` function do?
- How was `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);` different from `plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) );` and `plot(x.runif, ( x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif) ) );`?  How would you describe the shape of each of these plots?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- Rnorm generates n number of random numbers with a given mean and standard deviation.  It takes numbers from the normal distribution so numbers 
close to the mean are more likely. It differs from runif because not all numbers have equals chances to be chosen. Also takes a mean not two values to go between.
   Runif generates a given n number of numbers randomly between two given values, here 0 and 1 it different from rnorm because all numbers have equal chances of being chosen.--
   Sample generates a random sample from the given population, the sample size should be smaller than the given population.
   
   The differences between the plots are easy to see, the original plot(x.rnorm, x.runif) is a combination of them and you can see that runif causes the 
   dataset to go uniformial from the bottom to the top of the plot, whereas the rnorm is clustered towards the center.  This is different from 
   plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) ); because this is even more clustered towards the "mean" at the center of the graph there is
   no even distribution. whereas plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif) ); is evenly distributed thoughout the whole plot.  This is due to taking a sample of itself.
   and the way runif and rnorm work.

### (5 points) "Easter-Egg" Simulation 

- There was an "Easter Egg" that related to setting the seed `set.seed` using `rbinom`.  If you search in the BlackBoard discussion forum for `easter` you will see the discussion about August 25-27.
- In the "Easter Egg", the goal was to find a scenario using a specific `set.seed` that would simulate flipping a coin 100 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 52 times. 
- In this problem, the search criteria has changed.  Simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 555 times. 
- You need to report 5 values for `set.seed` that achieves this objective.  You can report more.  
- You should explicitly have the code print `length(x)` where `x` is a vector of the values that meet the objective.


```{r, chunk-simulating-rbinom, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

nsim = 500000;
y = 1:nsim;
ns = 0;
which = numeric(0);

for (i in y) 
{
  set.seed(i);
  res = rbinom(n = 1, 1000, 0.5);
  if (res == 555)
  {
    cat(i,sep="\n");
    ns = 1 + ns;
    which = c(which,i);
    #break
  }
}
which;
length(which);

#ns;
ns/nsim;
```


<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- which output is the seed values that match the criteria. uses length(which) to return how many values returned. --

### Rolling the Dice

- You have 3 dice.
- Each dice has the numbers `1:10` ... they are ten-sided die ("decader" die).
- Write the necessary `for-loops` to capture all possible outcomes of rolling the three dice at the same time.
- A dataframe `myrolls` should have three columns: `dice.1`, `dice.2`, `dice.3` plus a fourth column `roll.total` which is the sum `dice.1 + dice.2 + dice.3` of one iteration of the nested `for loop`.
- Report the dimensions `dim` of `myrolls`.
- Create a table `outcomes.table` that summarizes the counts of the `myrolls$roll.total` 
- Transform the table to a dataframe `outcomes.df`. Name the columns: c("roll.total", "count");
- Report the sum of `outcome.df$count`
- Create a new column `outcomes.df$prob` (Probability) that determines the probability of that row given the total sum of the `count` column.
- Display the dataframe.

#### Setting Up the Dice Scenario 
```{r, chunk-simulating-dice, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ...

dice.1 = dice.2 = dice.3 = 1:10;

myrolls = NULL;
for(d1 in dice.1)
  {
  for(d2 in dice.2)
    {
    for(d3 in dice.3)
      {
      roll.total = d1 + d2 + d3;
      row = c(d1, d2, d3, roll.total);
      myrolls = rbind(myrolls, row);
      }
    }
  }

myrolls = as.data.frame(myrolls);
colnames(myrolls) = c("dice.1", "dice.2", "dice.3", "roll.total");

myrolls;
print("Dimensions of myrolls");
dim(myrolls);

outcomes.table = table(myrolls$roll.total);
outcomes.df = as.data.frame(outcomes.table);
  colnames(outcomes.df) = c("roll.total", "count");


total.sum = sum(outcomes.df$count);
print("Sum of outcomes.df$count");
total.sum;

outcomes.df$prob = outcomes.df$count / total.sum;
outcomes.df;

```
#### Viewing a subset of data to answer a question  

- How many ways can I roll a 23 when I throw the dice at the same time?  What is the probability that I roll a 23 on a single throw?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-a, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## INITIAL EXPLORATION OF REAL DATA

We are going to use exploratory techniques to examine some Indeed.com data.  If you recall, this `job` data examines how many jobs reference a certain keyword.  Every Monday morning at 12:00:00AM EST (using a scheduler `crontab`), this data collection is performed.  A few weeks ago, I added some new keys words.  The data set we have consists of 5 weeks:  `2020-38` to `2020-42`.

- For each "search phrase", I go to Indeed.com and download the first page of results.  
- From this first page, I grab the "total count"
- An example is shown in a screenshot, taken this week.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### Import "jobs" data
- Run code to import the data `jobs`.

```{r, chunk-plotting-load-jobs, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
jobs = utils::read.csv( paste0(path.mshaffer, "_data_/indeed-jobs.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");

colnames(jobs) = c("year.week", "search.query", "job.count");
jobs;
```

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

- Create a `hist` and `boxplot` and report `summary(jobs$job.count)`.

### (5 points) Histogram and Box Plot 
```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-boxplot, cache.rebuild=TRUE}


hist(jobs$job.count, main = "Jobs")

boxplot(jobs$job.count)

summary(jobs$job.count)


```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- The histogram and boxplot both reinforce the idea that most companies job count is fairly low. This seems to show a huge amount of variance.  The majority are significantly less than the median, but there are some with over 400000.  The summary gives a little more detail to this with the median being 1734, and the mean being 15170. This shows
that most of the jobs have around 1000-2000, but go up to 404527.--

with adding more keywords every week that they post new jobs. They are parallel because they can only add so many new keywords every week and 
the companies that have been there longer have a higher amount of keywords. It is a constant upwards trend.

The Data analysis is in the middle of the pack trending upwards but at a slower pace than some of the higher up ones.  My perspective of it

#### Is "Microsoft Office" bigger than "C++"?

I use the term "bigger" or "better" intentionally.  We are comparing two items, and these are generic ways of communicating such a comparison.  In context of this data problem, a formalized form of the question would be something like:  "Utilizing job count for a given search query, determine if the query 'Microsoft Office' has a larger job count than the query 'C++'?"  This question will need to be formalized if we are trying to draw specific conclusions, but the initiation of analysis "which is bigger" allows us to understand what the data says or does not say, through exploration.  

To answer the question:

Mathematically, if two lines are parallel, and one is above the other, can we use **distance** to draw a conclusion?  Now, many times in statistics we deal with noise in the data, it is not "deterministic" but "stochastic" ... so we need to understand the variability.  Based on the data we see, can we not use  "parallel-line" logic to conclude that they are different?  This is one dimension of EDA, use mathematics. ("mathematics")

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(80,250) );

boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Microsoft Office", "C++");

```
Tukey invented the boxplot as a nice EDA representation of the data.  What logical inference can we make about the distances between the boxplots and the fact that no data is overlapping.  This is another dimension of EDA, use "distance" and the boxplot "IQR" to compare two elements.  What conclusion would we make? ("boxplot")

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- The logical inference about the distances between them is just the number of job.count that they are currently at. None of the data
overlaps because they are parallel lines with consistent upward growth, this isn't saying that one wouldn't pass the other though. Looking
at the IQR the q1 and q3 are fairly even for c++ growth. Whereas microsoft office is heavily weighted towards q3.

You get a little more information from the box plot on how the trends of the data are going but otherwise The data seems very similiar between 
the mathematics and boxplot.

I don't think we can know if the inferential test would show something different unless we do it, but
my hunch is that it wouldn't. The data seems pretty straightforward.--
</pre>

[Can we conclude the data are different based on "mathematics" or "boxplot"?

Would a formal "inferential statistical test" tell us something different than logical inference?  

How do you think "formal tests" were derived if not from "mathematics" and "boxplot" (EDA)?]

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft-answer, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

# courage in trusting your intuition may require a fall-back ... for those that need it ...

#### Is "Statistics" bigger than "Java"?

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(49,53) );

do.nothing = boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Statistics", "Java");


```

For this data, I can descriptively report that the third-quartile `Q3` of "Statistics" is about equal to the `median` of "Java".  The inter-quartile range (`IQR`) of each overlap.  The minimum value of "Java" is larger than the minimum value of "Statistics".  The maximum value of "Java" is slightly smaller than the maximum value of "Statistics".

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- Currently the "spread" of statistics is larger than java, but the median value of the values in java are still higher. So the median 
of the java set -50%- is about the same as the 75% marker for statistics. but the top of the data is still higher but a slight margin.
It looks to me that java is currently the larger of the two, but statistics is catching up quickly.--

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(14,17) );

boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Data science", "Big data");


```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- My conclusion is similar to the answer from the previous problem.  Data Science has a similar amount of jobs with that keyword right now, slightly less. But that is trending upwards and is set to surpass Big Data in total job count indexes quickly.  The median of Data Science is roughy equal to the
q1 of Big Data. but the median of big Data is significantly higher than Data Science. Up close to its own q3. It is fairly likely that they will both have the same keywords due to being similar jobs. An improved version of this search would be to only take jobs into account that don't have both keywords.  That way you can more accurately see the growth rate of each specific keyword.  Only when comparing sets of data though.--
</pre>

[Use "mathematics" and "boxplot" and "ttest" to make a conclusion.  

Next, think carefully about the nature of the data.  Is the "collection-approach" flawed to make a conclusion comparing job-counts of these specific keywords? How likely is it that a single-job posting may have both keywords?

This is an example where "data-integrity" knowledge would surpass the other three logical conclusions.

This intuition requires an understanding of what mathematicians call "set theory".  If I am doing an independent search on keywords, is it possible that one job would show up in multiple searches.  That is, being counted twice or more. 

Intuition and logic would also allow us to conclude that our other comparisons are "very likely okay".  Why?

What would be an improved approach to collecting the data that would allow me to more accurately compare these two keywords?

This is representative of why exploratory data analysis is essential.  It provides us insight into the domain and highlights the need for better data, if we can find it.

### Conclusions on logical inference

Distance is a fundamental unit of comparison.  We can use our "mathematical" understanding of distance.  We can use an "EDA" understanding of the data (e.g., the boxplot).  We need to understand the data sourcing and how that will relate to the logical conclusions we are trying to draw. 

When we transition to "confirmatory inferential statistics", we cannot leave our understanding of "maths" and "EDA" behind.  They are the foundation from which "inferential statistics" is built.  They are "logical inference".

## COMPUTING DISTANCES

If you recall, we had a notebook on collecting data from Wikipedia.  We documented the "data-provenance" protocols to make this happen.  We have documented and can replicate our data-collection strategies.

### (10 points) Data Provenance defined

Imagine you are preparing for a job interview.  Write a 90-second blurb describing "what is data provenance" and "why it matters".  I would suggest the STAR(S) approach mentioned in one of the notebooks.  Reference the "Wikipedia" project as an example of how one can implement the features.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- Data Provenance is a method of documenting where a piece of data comes from and processes and methods that were used to produce that
data. One of the most important aspects of Data provenance is have good data management.  In a past project that I used that involved putting zipcodes
  into a SQL database and running a query that returns the location/zipcode of everything within certain coordinates. So knowing the methods
  for finding that data and going through it is very important for knowing who I can query that information and what will display when I do query it. 
  The Quality of the results, accuracy, and reliability of the results are all paramount and having good data provenance is how to control that. 
  This resulted in a query that ran quickly and was able to be broken down into smaller queries to have a more specific subset of the data if needed.
  Such as getting everything needed from a certain zipcode as well as within specific coordinates.  This was all achieved with careful database management, 
  which is achieved through accurately recording database provenance.

#### (5 points) Comparing "Visualization Options"

Above, the data was displayed using three different visualization packages.

The first `plot_usmap` uses the ``ggplot2` methodology which is tied to the "tidyverse" landscape of the `R` community.

The second `voronoi.mosaic` uses the graph-theory topology known as Voroni partitioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram> with the "base" plot function to visualize the topology.

The last one `map` is from the "base" environment.

-- The one that is most appealing to me is the first graph done by the ggplot2 and tidyverse.  It has a map of the united states and 
the city names are put directly over where they are in real life in their respective states. It takes me almost no time to know which 
city goes to which state. 
Functionally I would assume that the Voronoi mosiac presents it most effectively because due the nature of the mosiac the corresponding region 
around the city is generated by how close they are to other cities. Giving it more accurate results when it comes to the distances between the cities.
a Key factor to whether we should put Alaska and Hawaii next to California is what type of data we are looking to show. If we just want to know 
what the state capitals are and what the states look like we can use the ggplot, but if we actually want to know distances between these places we need to use
another method. --

Visually, which is the most appealing to you?  Why?

When we create visualizations, it is essential to portray the data accurately.  For example, there are times when putting Alaska/Hawaii next to California might be appropriate, and other times it might not be.

#### (5 points) Building the distance matrix

The dataframe we are using has been named `latlong` to represent the latitudes and longitudes of the 50 U.S. cities in America.


```{r, chunk-distances-setup, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

# manual conversion
# how many miles is 1 degree of latitude
latitude.factor = 69;  # rough mile estimate  # 68.703 ?
latlong$x.lat = latlong$latitude * latitude.factor;

longitude.factor = 54.6;  # rough mile estimate  
latlong$y.long = latlong$longitude * longitude.factor;

  colnames(dist.meeus.m) = myLabels;

dist.meeus.df = as.data.frame( round( dist.meeus.m, digits=1) );

dist.meeus.df;  ## too big

lookupPairwiseValue(dist.meeus.df, "Juneau, AK", "Montgomery, AL");

-- No, Looking at the data above there isn't much difference between these two. Only a couple digits off per dataset.
The difference between Meeus and Haversine is that Haversine ignores ellipsoidal effects and it just shortest distance between two points

## HIERARCHICAL clustering as a function of distance

Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering" and is generally considered to be a "unsupervised learning" method.


### Introduction
We use `hclust` to perform Hierarchical Clustering.  The word "hierarchical" is used because the nature of the data is organized like a family genealogy.  The bottom of the tree represents the descendants that eventually "link" to a common ancestor.

If you type `?hclust` you can review the parameter options which we explored in a notebook.  `hclust` is primarily a function of `dist()` [distance], and we have just computed some distances, so we could try and apply `hclust` to our data to see if our state capitals will cluster into meaningful regions.

There are several agglomeration methods ("linkage") one could choose from.  Each method takes the `dist` <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Metric> and performs some pairwise distance algorithm called a linkage criteria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Linkage_criteria>.

I generally use either the "complete" linkage method or the "ward.D2" linkage method.  You can read help `?hclust` to better appreciate why: "A number of different clustering methods are provided. Ward's minimum variance method aims at finding compact, spherical clusters. The complete linkage method finds similar clusters."

If you are trying to link binary data (zeroes and ones) or genomic data (where the distances were computed using a genetic-distance algorithm), you may want to try the UPGMA approach: "average" or "centroid".  

### Analogy of Family

Since I am from a large family, I will make a family tree analogy.  For me, I am the 5th of 11 siblings (5 brothers, 5 sisters).  If I wanted to cluster the siblings in a pair-wise fashion, how would I begin?

First, I would ask, which other sibling is most like me?  Since this is a pair-wise approach, and there are 11 siblings, maybe at the initial stage, I will not be paired with another sibling.

In fact, at least one will not be paired because the total number is 11.  And maybe more than one will not be paired in the initial stage.  Remember "similarity" is being defined based on some distance-linkage method.  And to use this approach, "similarity" needs to numerical data.

At each stage, pair-wise joining occurs until there is nothing left to join.  The tree contains all of the elements.  Every element (branch) eventually joins the main branch (trunk) of the tree.  

### Clustering U.S. capital cities based on latitude, longitude

We already have some data for the U.S. capitals and have computed a Euclidean distance using a capital-city's longitude and latitude.  Let's choose to cut the result into `12` agglomerations.  Why 12?  It was a choice based on my life experience and intuition.  As I reflected on why, I did some external searching that validates a choice in that range <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States>.  You certainly could run this analysis with another choice  It is exploratory, and your intuition matters.

Geographically, I am saying the capital-city does represent the state.  An ideal representation may be in the center (centroid) of the state.  Remember this when we see the linkages with "New York", the city is Albany, not Manhattan.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## ward.D2
hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="ward.D2");

plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, 
      labels= myLabels );
rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );

## complete
# 
# hclust.complete.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="complete");
# 
# plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, 
#       labels= myLabels );
# rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );
#   

```

### Understanding the `cutree`

In the above example, the tree was cut into 12 groups based on the "distance" formula used and based on the "agglomeration" linkage technique invoice.  I likely should have used a "geo-spatial" distance, but we will see that mere "euclidean" distance seems to perform okay.  

A fancy word for this statistical tree is a "dendrogram".  I call each element of the tree a branch.  The smallest branches (twigs) are the fundamental elements, in this case the cities.  Over time, they merge with other small branches, and so on.

The relative height when this smallest branch merges with another branch demonstrates when the branch has found a similar pair-wise match (with another smallest branch or a merging branch).  I call "Honolulu Hawaii" an isolate because the vertical height when it merges with another branch is the highest of all of the smallest branches (e.g., cities).  "Juneau Alaska" is another isolate, but it does merge before "Hawaii".

It would be nice if we could decompose this information and look at one `cutree` at a time.  And color-code the distinctions.  Using the function `plot.hclust.sub` we can do this.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean-sub, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

source_url( paste0(path.github,"humanVerseWSU/R/functions-EDA.R") );  # EDA functions ...


hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean$labels = myLabels;

plot.hclust.sub(hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12);

#plot.hclust.sub(hclust.complete.dist.euclidean, k=12);
```

### (10 points) Review one clustering tree (dendrogram)

Choose either `hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean` or `hclust.complete.dist.euclidean` and review how the U.S. state capitals are clustered.  [I commented out one form, so you will have to re-run if you want to select that one.]

Comment on the "face validity" of this approach based on your understanding about how the U.S. regions are defined?  Are the North/South Dakotas together?  What about the North/South Carolinas?  What about the Pacific Northwest?  While living in Kentucky, some people called the area "Kentuckiana" meaning Kentucky/Indiana.  Does that show up?  Also note anything that seems peculiar.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- The face validity of this appears to be very effective.  It is using  elucidian distance which is how it is getting "outliers". For example,
you mentioned are north dakota and south dakotas capitals on the same branch and they are and while you would assume that north carolina and south carolina
would be as well but they aren't this is because richmond, Virginia is about 70 miles closer to Raleigh than raleigh, north carolina is to columbia, south carolina. They are clustered by distance not similarity in name. The pacific northwest is similar but since the citys are so spread out thy are in though own branches.  Kentucky and Indana do show up together, because indanapolis and frankfort are only 150 miles from each other.The data seems to make sense
to me, I can't find any outliers that don't abid by the distance rule. They are clustered by their relative distance to each other.--
</pre>


### Additional remarks about `hclust`

I find `hclust` to be a nice initial perusal of the data.  

If you want to understand the stability of a particular `hclust` to use it for something other than an "initial perusal of the data," I would recommend `pvclust` which I introduced in the weekly notebooks.  It is often used in peer-reviewed research, as it provides a `p-value` of sorts regarding the **stability** of the `hclust` structure.

## GENERIC clustering 
Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering".  In exploration, we can create some generic clustering techniques.  Below we will create two adhoc clustering rules.

### Arbitrary Aggregation

Recall the "movie dataset" with "Will Smith" and "Denzel Washington".  We have a collection of movies, and how much money each movie made at the box office.  We could organize those movies by some arbitrary rules.  For example:

- Cluster 1:  NA.  We have missing data regarding the money.  So let's put all movies that are NA into that cluster.
- Cluster 2:  Under a million dollars
- Cluster 3:  1-4.99... million dollars (greater than or equal to one, but less than 5)
- Cluster 4:  5-49.99... 
- Cluster 5:  50+

### Aggregating using Quantiles

John Tukey emphasized that ordering the data and then splitting it based on the ordering was a fundamental premise of exploratory data analysis.  

#### Tukey's Summary Data

John Tukey proposed five elements as primary data for analysis.

- the minimum `min`
- the maximum `max`

Sorting the data makes it easiest to find these data, and will be useful to find the other three exploratory summary features.

This is what I would call "slice and dice".  The data is cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting point" is the `Q2` which we call the `median`.

Next, the lower half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q1`.

Then, the upper half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q3`.

A common metric derived from this "median-split" procedure is called the interquartile range `IQR` which is defined as the distance between `Q3` and `Q1`.  It literally represents the middle 50% of the data; 50% of the elements of the dataset are between `Q3` and `Q1`.  


<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### Quartile Example 
```{r, chunk-quartiles, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = 1:99;
length(x);

median(x);
x[50];

median(x[1:49]);
x[25];

median(x[51:99]);
x[75];

# probability-approach ... 
# algorithm: the default type=7
stats::quantile(x, prob = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), type=1);

```

Algorithms address various issues associated with dividing numbers and whether or not to include the dividing number in the subset division, but the principle holds.

We can generalize this idea by not always cutting the data in half (median-split as `n=2`, median-median-split as `n=4`).  Instead, we could cut by tens (we call them deciles).  Or we could cut by hundreds (we call them centiles).  The function `quantile` performs this operation, and if you dig into the `doStatsSummary` function used in this course, you can see its application.

## CENTROID clustering (k-means) as a function of distance

### Introduction
Rather than clustering on distance-linkage in a pair-wise fashion, we can cluster based on randomly selecting just `k` points in our data and begin identifying their nearest neighbors using some distance approach.

For example, if `k=3`, we would randomly select three of our data points.  We would then compute the distances from all of the remaining points to these `3` anchor points.  The points that are closest to a given anchor will be assigned to that anchor.  At the end of the stage, we now have new data, so a new centroid is determined.  At this point, the centroid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid> is likely not one of our data points, but a location within the given centroid cluster.  In the "naive" approach, you merely take an average (mean) of all the members of your cluster.  More advanced approaches (the default "Hartigan-Wong" of `kmeans`) utilize deviations from the average, called a sum-of-squares approach.  This is why in our `kmeans-notebook` we analyzed the `wss` to ascertain how many clusters `k` should we use.

Regardless, after the new centroids (centers) for the clusters are determined, the process iterates.  All distances are computed from all points to the new centroids; points are assigned to a given centroid cluster (in this example: 1, 2, 3); a new centroid center is computed, and we repeat the process until a stopping rule is reached: maybe we have exhausted the number of iterations allowed (`iter.max` parameter of `kmeans`)?  Or maybe we are not changing membership of any of the data points?  Or maybe we have met some objective (like `wss`)?

It is possible to get a `kmeans` result by merely starting with `3 different` random points.  In general, `kmeans` is fast (and our computers are so much faster than the computers of 1990: the first computer I built in 1995 had 32MB of RAM, a Pentium processor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium#Pentium> and a 900MB Cheetah hard-drive).

Anyway, we can utilize the parameter `nstart` to try many different starting values, and let the program identify the best, most consistent solution.

### My recommendations

I would recommend the default algorithm `Hartigan-Wong` with `iter.max=100` and `nstart=100`.  You can test the timings from the default values: `iter.max=10` and `nstart=1`.  Since the data is likely multidimensional `stars` are the best way to summary the results and membership of `kmeans`.  Please see the "kmeans-notebook" for examples.

### WIKIPEDIA CLIMATE DATA

For the 50 U.S. cities, we harvested climate data.  In the "Wikipedia" notebook, details of that data provenance were outlined.  If we want to compare the cities using the climate data, we have to build a matching dataframe, which means we have to select features that exist in each city's climate data set.

There are four temperature features that are always present:

- Record high F (C) ... we will call it "high.max"
- Average high F (C) ... we will call it "high.avg"
- Average low F (C) ... we will call it "low.avg"
- Record low F (C)  ... we will call it "low.max" [probably not the best name choice, but it is parallel in form to the first element]

Additionally, for precipitation we have:

- Average precipitation inches (mm) ... we will call it "rain"
- Average snowfall inches (cm) ... we will call it "snow"

For each of these features we have 12 months of data.  This is a nice dataset.  Let's see what we can do with it.


#### Basic Background Research
We should begin by doing a bit of peripheral research on the topic, to gain "domain knowledge" so we know what to do with the data.  A few elements that would benefit.

-- I find the sun showing the hottest day of the year is very informative and helpful, along with the temperature charts on the left and right sides of the page.
The snowfall and rain portions are also very easy to read and comprehend.  The part that I have the biggest issue with is in the Helena graphic it shows two lowest temperatures.
I am not sure the reasoning for this but it seems needlessly confusing.  It is aesthetically pleasing to look at especially the helena one with the mirrored snow graphic.
It seems functional enough if you just want to know the general temperatures for the area at specific times of the year, but for more specific data it doesn't seem that useful.
Like if you wanted to know the temperature average for a specific week in that month the data doesn't show that.  But that might be the best yearly weather graphic that I have ever seen.  It works very well.

This double plotted graphic is significantly better for comparing the two cities, The only downside I see compared to the first graphic is that
the Y axis needed to be scaled down to let it fit, but it is still completely legible and understandable. The rain is still very easy to read as well, but to know had to be changed and because of that is less legible.  The gridlines appear to be exactly the same
from the way it was before.  But if you are asking if the gridlines between baton rouge and helena are the same then no.  Helenas gridlines have to go significantly lower due to the temperatures getting so much colder in the winter. As well ans Baton Rouges going a little higher due to it being hotter in the summer. I probably would have seperated rain and snow for this version due to space constraints and readability.--

##### (5 points) One Publication Graph

We are in exploration, so the "one" research graphic may be very different than the "one" formal graphic designed for a client.  Typically, the final graphic needs to meet certain criteria:

- Very pleasing aesthetically 
- Interactive if possible
- Live data feeds if possible
- Served in a secure, safe, private location (if required by the client)

To demonstrate the differences, I created a mockup of our 50 U.S. cities and put it into a nice finalized product form called "highcharts".  

<http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_EXAMPLES_/fiddle_usmap/>

It pulls data in real time (using AJAX) to grab the weather at the latitudes/longitudes we defined in our Wikipedia notebook.  

- You can use your mouse to draw a box to zoom in.  
- The third-wheel on the mouse also helps you zoom in/out.
- Hold down CNTRL with your left hand and use your mouse key to drag the map.  It seems to only "pan" in the x-direction at the moment.  
- The data in the popup displayed can be customized.  I report the temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit and also display the population data we gathered from Wikipedia. 

Once you have a template built, it is rather easy to modify it.  Here I changed the background map, and all of the data/features stay the same:

<http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_EXAMPLES_/fiddle_usmap/world.html>


<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">
### Which Features to Include in the Analysis

* months, you can pick all of them `1:12` or maybe just one month per season (April, July, October, January)
* X, depending on what you chose for months, you can now select what climate columns you want to use
  - Some of Temperature Data
  - All of Temperature Data
  - Precipitation Data
  - Everything (All of Temperature Data, Precipitation Data)
  
If we want to cluster cities, which decisions seem best?  Why?  As you can see from the code below, you just comment out two options, and can quickly rerun the analysis.

- WHICH MONTHS
- WHICH COLUMNS

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH MONTHS & WHICH COLUMNS
```{r, chunk-climate-which-features, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

climate = utils::read.csv( paste0(path.mshaffer, "_data_/state-capitals/final/state-capitals-climatedata.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");

##################### WHICH MONTHS #####################
########################################################
#months = 1:12; # all the data
months = c(1,4,7,10); # one month of each of the four seasons
########################################################


month.abb;  # ?month.abb
month.name;  

month.name[months];  # these are the names of the months you are selecting ...


# this function would allow us to use different months as criteria and different climate-data keys.  It is variadic and flexible.  `key.n` are the names we will use for our new columns ...

climate.df = buildClimateDataFrame(climate, months, keys=c("Record high F (C)", "Average high F (C)", "Average low F (C)", "Record low F (C)", "Average precipitation inches (mm)", "Average snowfall inches (cm)"), keys.n = c("highmax", "highavg",  "lowavg", "lowmin", "rain", "snow") );

climate.df;
names(climate.df); # this helps you see the indexes ...

##################### WHICH COLUMNS #####################
########################################################
#X = climate.df[,5:52];  # temperature
#X = climate.df[,5:76];  # everything (includes rain)
#X = climate.df[,5:20];  # temperature, 1 month per season
X = climate.df[,5:28];  # everything (includes rain), 1 month per season
########################################################


  rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);
```

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

### To scale or not to scale, that is the question

```{r, chunk-distances-X-or-Xs, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

X = climate.df[,5:28];  # everything ... you have to change months above to get this dataframe to be the correct size ... months = 1:12
  rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);

```


So let's do some analysis with all of the data available to us.  Most of the data is in Temperature, with ranges from -42 degrees Fahrenheit (Helena, Montana) to 122 (Phoenix, Arizona).

The precipitation data (rain and snow) is measured in inches.  So should we scale the data.  The answer in PCA and orthogonal projections is absolutely YES, but for `hclust` and `kmeans` is that always the case?

You can make a choice below, and observe how it influences your answers. 

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH X
```{r, chunk-distances-whichX, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

whichX = X;
#whichX = Xs;

```

<HR divider="5" style="border: 5px solid #981e32; border-radius: 5px;">
### Perform `k-means` on All Climate Features

With the selected features let's perform k-means.  Let's select k=12.  I will select all of the features, but you can change that if you wish.

#### Descriptives of Sample
```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-setup-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}



colors = rainbow(50, s = 0.6, v = 0.75); # 50 colors for 50 states

# descriptive star plot to start
stars(whichX, len = 0.5, key.loc=c(12,2), draw.segments = TRUE);

## too busy, let's group them
x.start = 1;
x.end = 10;
for(i in 1:5)
  {
  stars( whichX[x.start:x.end,] , 
          len = 0.5, key.loc=c(6,2), draw.segments = TRUE);
  x.start = 1 + x.end;
  x.end = 10 + x.end;
  }

```

Above, you are just analyzing the general shapes.  Which ones are "fuller" circles?  Why?  

Which ones are not very "full circles"?  Why?

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Computation of Clusters/Centroids


```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-run-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

k = 12;
iterations = 100;
number.starts = 100;

whichX.kmeans = kmeans(whichX, 12, 
                    iter.max=iterations, 
                    nstart = number.starts);  # default algorithm
stars(whichX.kmeans$centers, len = 0.5, key.loc = c(10, 3),
        main = "Algorithm: DEFAULT [Hartigan-Wong] \n Stars of KMEANS=12", draw.segments = TRUE);

```

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Cluster Membership and Centroid Attributes


```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-table-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}



membership = matrix( whichX.kmeans$cluster, ncol=1);
membership = membership[order(membership),];
membership = as.data.frame(membership);
        rownames(membership) = climate.df$labels;
        colnames(membership) = c("Cluster");

membership;

print( table(membership) ) ; 

# I believe in an older version of R these were called $centroids
attributes = as.data.frame( whichX.kmeans$centers );
    rownames(attributes) = paste0("Cluster.",1:12);
  attributes;
    
```

## (15 points) Correlation

Correlation, like distance, is an important feature of multivariate analysis.  So let's review some basic correlation related to our climate data.  For simplicity, let's consider "Record High Temperature" and "Record Low Temperature" and see how they correlate with other factors we have gathered from Wikipedia.

Recall, in this table, "Jan-Dec" are different months of the same temperature variable.  

```{r, chunk-correlations-high, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

high = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record high F (C)",1));
high = merge(high, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

high.X = high[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
high.cor = round( cor(high.X), digits=2);
# high.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(high.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance ... # str(high.cor.p);

# examine July (idx = 7)

as.data.frame( high.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

high.cor.july = high.cor[,7];
high.cor.july;

plot(high.cor.july)

```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- The correlation of July to the other factors is in how closely related their datasets are.  The farther you get from july the lower the correlation(temperatures go down)
as the temperatures rise and months come back closer to July the correlation goes up.

X is correlated with Y(0.00) which is an extremely weak correlation this is weak because it is the farthest from each other you can get.  Overall this suggests the farther
you get away from X the closer you get to Y. x(0.00) = y(1.00).

There also seems to be the correlation between time of year and population in the area.  It seems that in the summer months the July/August the population
goes down significantly, this can be due to many reasons.  My guess would be family vacations due to school being out or temperatures being so warm that they
go somewhere cooler for a few months.  the population tends to rise as you leave the summer  months with june being the most populous.

we Plotted the high.cor values and can see the trends.  As the values move towards jult the correlation goes up and as they move away it goes down.
It also shows that the closer the latitude to zero in general, unless it is at the perfect spot (here-- -30) we can see that the population goes down.
</pre>

Describe the correlation of July in "Record high F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 

**x is correlated with y (0.00).  This correlation is positive/negative which means ...  This correlation is strong/weak because ... overall, this suggests ... **

- July perfectly correlates with July (1.00).  This correlation is positive and very strong.  This is because they are the same data.
- With the months, you can note each, or plot a trend showing them, and discussing them briefly as a trend.
- latitude is a measure of north/south, so be certain to apply the correlation value with some meaning.  be certain you know which direction is positive or negative to correctly interpret the sign of the correlation.
- longitude is a measure of east/west, so be certain ...
- population is the size of the city  

- intuitively, which months do you think correlate most with latitude for this data?  which correlate the least?  is the correlation always the same sign (positive/negative), or does it change? [You can use the dataframe output to do this analysis, or create your own subset]

```{r, chunk-correlations-low, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

low = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record low F (C)",1));
low = merge(low, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

low.X = low[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
low.cor = round( cor(low.X), digits=2);
# low.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(low.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance ... # str(low.cor.p);

# examine Jan (idx = 1)

as.data.frame( low.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

low.cor.january = low.cor[,1];
low.cor.january;

plot(low.cor.january)

```

Describe the correlation of January in "Record low F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 


<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- The data has consitently high latitudes and the longitude goes down from january to december.  The values are extremely different than for July though.
The correlation only fluxuates by around .26 from january to July. Also in contrast the population seems to rise in the summer months and fall in the winter months in this dataset.  Suggesting the opposite from the original data, that the populations rise in the summer and fall in the winter.  Which does make sense for cold climates.  They are generally beautiful in the summer and deathly cold in the winter.--
</pre>

Similar to "high" writeup, but for the "low" data.

## "So What" is DATA ANALYSIS?

In the social sciences (e.g., Karl Weick), the concept of "sense making" refers to "the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences".  I have used this framework in my high-technology innovation research (See Figure 1 of <http://www.mshaffer.com/arizona/pdf/LoneGenius.pdf>, my rubric concept comes from learning-theory growth models:  Nascent, Adolescent, Mature.) 

This final topic is reflective:  we are thinking about how we think.

### Statistics

The syllabus defined statistics as "the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data." (See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics>)

There are 5 elements mentioned:  collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data".  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 20% of our time to each of those?  Now, consider the "analysis" stage.  I have suggested there are two camps:  exploratory and confirmatory data analysis.  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 50% of our time to each of those?  Now, in an "equally-likely" scenario, we would have.

```{r, chunk-conclusion-equally-likely, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = c(20,20,10,10,20,20);
x.labels = c("collection", "organization", "EDA analysis", "CDA analysis", "interpretation", "presentation");
x.colors = c("blue", "lightgreen", "green", "darkgreen", "orange", "red");

barplot(x, 
        col = x.colors,
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        ylab = "Proportion: (Sums to 100)",
        main="Statistics as the Study of 'Data'");


text(1.14* (1:6), par("usr")[3], col = x.colors, labels = x.labels, srt = 45, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=.75);
```

### Data Analytics

<IMG src="http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_images_/data-analytics.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" />
<div>**Source: https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/197-2/ ** (Accessed October 2010) </div>

"Data analytics is the application of powerful new methods—drawn from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and domain sciences—to collect, curate, analyze, discover and communicate knowledge from 'big data'." <https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/> (Accessed October 2010)


#### Importance of 'Data'

I love data.  

I also love math/physics.  I also love exploratory data analysis.  I also love computational statistics or statistical computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics>.  I also love thinking about developing the one graphic to summarize data most effectively.

#### Apprenticeship as Learning a Trade
The idea of sharing in the learning process is an important aspect of the apprenticeship model.  You are learning a trade (data analytics).  I have experience in this trade.  My job as the instructor is to provide you with a variety of "situated-learning" experiences To help you understand the nature of the trade.   This exam is an example of such an experience.

#### Tools of the Trade

Below are the core requirements for the data analytics program:

* Calculus and linear algebra (10 credits)
* Computer science fundamentals (11 credits)
* Machine learning and data management (9 credits)
* Statistics (15 credits)
* Data analytics introduction, ethics & project-focused * capstone experience (9 credits)

These are not the tools of the trade, but hopefully, they introduce you to key tools of the trade.  What exactly are tools of the trade? [You will have an opportunity to write a response below.]

#### Dimensional Reduction, an Axiomatic View

This video was recently shared with me that highlights some distinctions among persons practicing various forms of data analysis <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGlCi9jOWY>.  As an orthogonal projection, I would create two axes.  On the horizontal axis (x-axis), I would place "theory of data" to the left and "application of data" toward the right.  On the vertical axis (y-axis), I would place "care for data integrity" at the top and "less care for data integrity" at the bottom.

#### Skills of the Trade

As someone that is coming from industry, having hired young people like you out of Computer Science, Electrical-Computer Engineering, I have opinions related to skills of the trade.

* Can you acquire an appreciation for "data intimacy"?
* Can you track and document how data is curated?
* Can you track and document the analyses you perform?  Can you recreate them?  Do you have basic version-control protocols in place?
* Can you view data from multiple perspectives and synthesize those perspectives to identify the central them of the data?  Can you be objective?  Can you try and identify objective metrics to enlighten your understanding about the essence of data?
* Can you experiment with different visualizations in search of an optimal "one graphic" result?  Do you have practice using various visualization tools?  Can you comprehend which visualization tool is appropriate for messaging (communicating results) to a particular audience?
* Can you communicate and defend your findings to a particular audience?  Are your communications professional?  Is the final work product both simple and comprehensive:  simple in its summary findings and comprehensive in its ability to be replicated and audited as necessary.

-- 1. 
(1) what proportion of "statistics" should be divided among: collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data" ... providing a `barplot` of your opinion within your response would seem appropriate.
  This is a very interesting and thought provoking question and I do think it is base entirely on opinion.  Some people might feel like anyone of those categories is more important than the others. I adjusted the above bar graph to show my thoughts on the importance of each category.  I personally feel like collection is the most important category, A mistake in this category will effect all future categories significantly. I also lowered organization to compensate, because I feel like this is slightly less important than collection or even presentation.I then raise EDA anaylsis a little bit above CDA analysis because I think the thought you put behind the EDA analysis is more important to statistics then the verification. But both are important.  Your interpretation is the second highest factor.  This is very important in statistics.  You need to be able to interpret the data you have analyzed correctly or everything you have done is pointless.  Then presentation I lowered a little bit because While yes it important how to display your data to the public.  It seems less important than how you interpreted the data.
  
  2. (2) what tools of the trade should you be acquiring from the core courses?  how are you doing in that acquisition process (e.g., tool X is ... and right now I feel like my understanding/proficiency of tool X ... ) ...
  From the Calculus and Linear Algebra courses, which I feel might be the least important to this field. Though I am majoring in Software Engineering, not Data Analytics, so for some of the classes I don't have much experience.  But these classes are still very important, data scientists use calculus in almost every data model they make, and knowing how to make matrices and use vectors from linear algebra are also very important. I am doing okay in this part, I enjoyed calculus and linear algebra when I took those classes. The computer Science Fundementals before I took this class I didn't personally know that data scientists used much coding. But after learing Rstudio I stand corrected. Knowing how to write if statements and for loops as well as basic coding knowledge is paramount to understand RStudio and how the data is being analyzed through the system. I am lucky to be in Software because it helped me understand Rstudio faster than I think I would have had I not taken so many software classes before I am doing fairly well here. 
  I am currently taking a machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence class as well as a database course I took last semester.  Knowing how to organize your data using rational algebra in SQL is an obvious help to this path.  I would say that course was the most necessary course I took to understanding large datasets that I have taken, until this class. My machine learing class I personally can't think of why it would help data analytics other than making collecting and running the data more streamlined. I feel like this category I am also pretty strong in due to Databases.  Statistics I feel like has to be the most important when it comes to data Analysis.  This is data interpretation and analysis.  The way you Interpret and analyze the data is of upmost importance. This is probably my weakest category because I have done this the least, I haven't taken many stats classes.
  
  (3) utilize the provided `plot` script to place the coure-course categories on the proposed x-y graph related to analytics practice (Applied vs Theoretical) and care of data integrity (Great Care vs Little Care) ... Also place your personal assessment on the plot script provided. Inputted

   Can you acquire an appreciation for "data intimacy"? I believe I can. I am currently Developing(Adolescent) in this category. I am learning a great deal about that in my machine learning class, as well as this course.  This skill requires a great knowledge of math/stats/and software.
   
   Can you track and document how data is curated? In this category I believe I am also Developing/maybe moving slightly past that. I have been working with data for a long time and I am beginning to understand how to do data discovery and retrieval, maintaining quality, and re using data over time.
   
   * Can you track and document the analyses you perform?  Can you recreate them?  Do you have basic version-control protocols in place? I am fairly low on this
   still emerging. I haven't done maybe analyses of data before this class.  I can track what I am doing but I am hard pressed to recreate them.
   
   n you view data from multiple perspectives and synthesize those perspectives to identify the central them of the data?  Can you be objective?  Can you try and identify objective metrics to enlighten your understanding about the essence of data?  I feel like this is also still developing, but I have been trying to train myself to look at data though multiple lenses, and try not to get stuck on one conclusion from the data before I really explore the dataset. I also do try to identify metrics to help my understanding of the data.  But one issue I share in this class with my software classes is I have a hard time starting,  Once get started I can really immerse myself in the data/program.  But I have a hard time getting my brain to the starting line.
   
   Can you experiment with different visualizations in search of an optimal "one graphic" result?  Do you have practice using various visualization tools?  Can you comprehend which visualization tool is appropriate for messaging (communicating results) to a particular audience?  I feel like this is one that I have experience on from my math course/ols stats courses.  Knowing what type of data to match with which type of graph is a very important tool for communicating the results to the audience. I am still developing in this topic, but I do feel like I understand graphs better than most other topics.  I don't have any practice using a software tool for making graphs other than RStudio.  But I really feel like I am beginning to understand how it works.
   
   
    Can you communicate and defend your findings to a particular audience?  Are your communications professional?  Is the final work product both simple and comprehensive:  simple in its summary findings and comprehensive in its ability to be replicated and audited as necessary.
    This is also developing.  I try to be as clean and concise with my results or findings as possible. I do seem to find that if I have been writing for a significant portion of time I tend to starting rambling a little bit. I have kept this exam fairly informal due to time constraints, but if can comminicate professionally when needed.  The final work tends to be simple to understand but could be a little more comprehensive in scope.
   
   
   (4) Any other comments you would like to share.
   Very interesting exam.  Ended up enjoying it much more than I anticipated.  Have a great week.
